# üìÑ OS-Security Paper Reviews

This directory is a space to organize only paper reviews related to operating system and system security within the `OS-Security-Study` project.

> Target area: **Operating system kernel, memory model, vulnerability, Linux security mechanism, etc.**

## üìå Purpose

- Understand OS and kernel-based security papers structurally
- Connect with direct hands-on/theoretical learning flow
- Use insights for lab contacts and research plans

## üìö Review Structure Example

Each paper is organized in the following structure:

- Paper title + link
- Core problem (WHY)
- Technical approach (HOW)
- Results and significance (WHAT)
- Received insights / My own questions

## ‚úçÔ∏è Recommended usage method

- After organizing the concepts in `OS-Security-Fundamentals`, link to related paper reviews
- Flow structure to reproduce the technology from each paper in a practical environment
- Used as a tool to concretize technical curiosity when contacting a lab
