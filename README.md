# 🛡️ OS Security Study

This repository was created to deeply understand **the basic concepts and security principles of the operating system (OS), and to establish a **structural foundation\*\* for graduate school advancement and system security research.

## 🚩 Purpose (Why?)

So far, I have dealt with high-level security issues such as blockchain and smart contracts.

However, I felt that **a true security researcher needs to deeply understand security principles at the system and OS level**.

This repository is a space to **learn and record the fundamental principles of system security from a low-level perspective**.

**In the long term, this repository aims to:**

- Securing basic stamina for system security research
- Cultivating vulnerability discovery and analysis capabilities at the OS and kernel levels
- Accumulating basic knowledge for proposing a realistic security model

We aim to foster understanding of security principles at the low level of OS and systems through methods such as organizing OS system concepts, fostering basic OS security concepts, and exploring related papers.

## 📖 Current learning progress (What?)

Currently, we are studying conceptual learning centered on OS textbooks and basic knowledge of system security,
and we plan to study the following in the next step:

- Linux kernel code review
- CVE vulnerability reproduction practice
- Review and apply the latest system security papers

> 🔥 It is still in the early stages, but we will continue to develop steadily in the future
> and lay the foundation for realistic system security research.

## 📌 Core competencies to emphasize

- **Self-directed learning ability:** Organize the contents of the operating system course on your own and continuously develop them.
- **Structural thinking ability:** Seek to identify the root cause of individual security issues and expand them to the system level.
- **Consistency and sincerity:** Emphasize the will to set long-term goals and develop them gradually.

## 🚧 Future Development Plans (TODOs)

- [v] Upload the existing OS organization content in the form of a Hangul file by converting it to Markdown format
- [ ] Build a Linux kernel environment (Configure a simple OS kernel analysis environment using QEMU)
- [ ] Select actual CVE cases to reproduce vulnerabilities and write attack scenarios
- [ ] Continue to prepare for advancement to the lab by regularly adding system security paper reviews
